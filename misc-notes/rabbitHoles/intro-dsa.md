# Intro to Data Structures
* The basic idea of a data structure is to store data in a way that meets the needs of your particular application.
* The data structure you choose will depend on the data you are working with and what you want to do with it.
* Storing data in one giant array would be rather time consuming to locate a specific value if you had a significant number and depth of items.

* The differences between most data structures typically have to do with trade-offs between how long it takes to first populate the structure, how long it takes to add or find elements and how large the structure is in memory.

* The most common data structures you will encounter in web development are:
  - Arrays
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Linked Lists
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables

### Data Structures Explained
* A more specific definititon of a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the function or operations that can be applied to the data. 

### Examples
* **Array**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
* **Linked List**: A collection of elements where each element points to the next.
* **Record (struct)**: A collection of elements, possibly of different types, identified by a single name.
* **Hash tables/maps**: A collection of key-value pairs where the key is generated by a hash function.
* **Graph**: A collection of nodes with edges between them.
* **Stack**: A _LIFO_ collection of elements with two principle operations: push and pop. LAST IN, FIRST OUT!
  // The last item added is the first to be removed. Think of a stack of plates.
* **Queue**: A _FIFO_ collection of elements with two principle operations: enqueue and dequeue. FIRST IN, FIRST OUT!
  // The first item added is the first to be removed. Think of a line at the grocery store. 
* **Tree**: A collection of nodes with a parent-child relationship.
* **Heap**: A collection of nodes with a parent-child relationship where each parent node is either greater than or equal to (max heap) or less than or equal to (min heap) its child nodes (remember? the Cartesian Tree ðŸŒ²!).
* **Trie**: A collection of nodes where each node represents a common prefix of a string.
* **Set**: A collection of unique elements.
* **Map**: A collection of key-value pairs where the key is unique.
