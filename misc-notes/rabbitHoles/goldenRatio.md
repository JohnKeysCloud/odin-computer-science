The **Golden Ratio** is a mathematical constant that is approximately equal to 1.618033988749895. It is represented by the Greek letter phi (`ϕ`). The golden ratio is a special number that has many interesting properties and applications in mathematics, art, architecture, and nature. It is derived from the Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers converges to the golden ratio as the sequence progresses.

Formula:
`ϕ = (1 + √5) / 2`

Properties:
- The golden ratio is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction.
- The golden ratio is a unique number that has the property of self-similarity, meaning that it can be divided into two parts in such a way that the ratio of the larger part to the smaller part is equal to the ratio of the whole to the larger part.

Applications:
- The golden ratio is often used in art and architecture to create aesthetically pleasing compositions and designs.
- The golden ratio is found in many natural phenomena, such as the spiral patterns of shells, the branching patterns of trees, and the proportions of the human body.
- The golden ratio is used in mathematics and science to model and analyze complex systems and patterns.
