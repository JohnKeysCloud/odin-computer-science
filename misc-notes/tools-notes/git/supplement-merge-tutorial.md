### Step-by-Step Tutorial

#### Step 1: Set Up a Repository

1. **Create a New Directory and Initialize a Git Repository**
```sh
mkdir git-conflict-demo
cd git-conflict-demo
git init
```

2. **Create a Sample File**
```sh
echo "This is the first line of the file." > conflict-file.txt
```

3. **Add and Commit the File**
```sh
git add conflict-file.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit with conflict-file.txt"
```

#### Step 2: Create a Branch and Make Changes

1. **Create a New Branch**
```sh
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

2. **Make Changes in the New Branch**
```sh
echo "This is a line from the feature branch." >> conflict-file.txt
   ```

3. **Add and Commit the Changes**
```sh
git add conflict-file.txt
git commit -m "Add line from the feature branch"
```

#### Step 3: Switch Back to Main Branch and Make Conflicting Changes

1. **Switch Back to the Main Branch**
```sh
git checkout main
```

2. **Make Conflicting Changes in the Main Branch**
```sh
echo "This is a line from the main branch." >> conflict-file.txt
```

3. **Add and Commit the Changes**
```sh
git add conflict-file.txt
git commit -m "Add line from the main branch"
```

#### Step 4: Merge the Feature Branch into Main and Resolve Conflict

1. **Attempt to Merge the Feature Branch into Main**
```sh
git merge feature-branch
```

At this point, you should see a merge conflict message:
```sh
Auto-merging conflict-file.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in conflict-file.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

2. **Check the Status to See the Conflict**
```sh
git status
```

You should see output indicating the conflict:
```sh
On branch main
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
  both modified:   conflict-file.txt
```

3. **Open the File to Resolve the Conflict**
```sh
nano conflict-file.txt
```

The file will look something like this:
``` sh
This is the first line of the file.
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a line from the main branch.
=======
This is a line from the feature branch.
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

4. **Resolve the Conflict by Editing the File**
   Modify the file to resolve the conflict. For example:
```sh
This is the first line of the file.
This is a line from the main branch.
This is a line from the feature branch.
```

5. **Add the Resolved File**
```sh
git add conflict-file.txt
```

6. **Commit the Merge**
```sh
git commit
```

Git will automatically use the merge commit message:
```sh
Merge branch 'feature-branch'
```

#### Step 5: Verify the Merge

1. **Check the Log to Verify the Merge Commit**
```sh
git log --oneline --graph
```

You should see a history like this:
``` sh
*   3e5d4c7 (HEAD -> main) Merge branch 'feature-branch'
|\  
| * 8f6e2f5 (feature-branch) Add line from the feature branch
* | 6a3c5b9 Add line from the main branch
|/  
* 4f2d8a0 Initial commit with conflict-file.txt
```

Congratulations! You've successfully created and resolved a merge conflict using Git from the command line. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
